                            Robotic process automation (RPA) is a software
                            technology that makes it easy to build, deploy, and
                            manage software robots that emulate humans actions
                            interacting with digital systems and software. Just
                            like people, software robots can do things like
                            understand whatâ€™s on a screen, complete the right
                            keystrokes, navigate systems, identify and extract
                            data, and perform a wide range of defined actions.
                            But software robots can do it faster and more
                            consistently than people, without the need to get up
                            and stretch or take a coffee break.
